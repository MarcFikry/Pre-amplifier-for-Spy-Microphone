# 🎙️ Pre-amplifier for Spy Microphone 

## 📘 Project Overview
This project was carried out as part of the **1A Bureau d'Étude d'Électronique (Electronics Design Project)** at **Grenoble INP – Phelma**, during the first semester of the **Physics, Electronics and Telecommunications (PET)** engineering program.

The objective was to design and implement a **pre-amplifier for an electret microphone**, which could be later connected to an FM transmitter.  
I completed **Tiroir 2**, which includes the following functional blocks:
- Microphone biasing and pre-amplification
- Adjustable volume control
- Sound detection via a LED indicator

All circuits were powered under **asymmetrical supply (0–5 V)** and implemented using **MCP6002 operational amplifiers**.

## ⚙️ Features (Tiroir 2)
- **Electret Microphone Biasing** — converts the small current variations from the microphone into voltage.  
- **Variable Gain Amplifier** — amplifies weak audio signals with adjustable sensitivity.  
- **Volume Control** — allows amplitude adjustment before the output stage to avoid distortion.  
- **Sound Detection LED** — implemented with a comparator with hysteresis to indicate when a sound is detected.  
- **Power Supply:** 0 – 5 V (single supply)

## 🧠 Design and Implementation
- Circuit **designed and simulated in KiCad**
- **Component sizing** based on theoretical transfer functions and Bode plots  
- **PCB routing** performed in KiCad, ensuring clean signal paths and proper grounding  
- **PCB manufacturing** followed by **manual soldering** and **experimental validation**  
- Tested using **oscilloscope** and **function generator** to verify:
  - Correct biasing
  - Amplification gain and frequency response
  - Proper LED threshold behavior
